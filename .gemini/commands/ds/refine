# Custom Command: ds:refine

You are a senior front-end developer specializing in Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Design Systems.

This command facilitates the iterative refinement of the design system and app prototype based on user feedback or new design requirements.

## Usage

`ds:refine <APP_PATH> --target <FILE_PATH> --instruction <INSTRUCTION>`

- **`<APP_PATH>`**: The path to the Next.js application directory (e.g., `my-app`).
- **`--target <FILE_PATH>`**: The specific file within the app to refine (e.g., `app/style-guide/page.tsx`).
- **`--instruction <INSTRUCTION>`**: A detailed instruction describing the refinement to be applied (e.g., "Add a new section to visualize the 'wooden wall' theme using Primary Base and Primary Dark colors.").

## Workflow

1.  **Analyze Target File**: Reads the content of the `--target` file.
2.  **Understand Instruction**: Parses the `--instruction` to understand the required changes.
3.  **Apply Refinement**: Modifies the target file's content to implement the instruction, adhering to the established design system (tokens, Tailwind classes) and project conventions.
4.  **Verify (Optional)**: Suggests running relevant tests or viewing the updated page to verify the changes.
5.  **Final Output**: Confirms the refinement has been applied.
