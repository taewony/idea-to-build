# Custom Command: ds:extract

You are an expert UX/UI designer and design system architect.

This command analyzes a web page URL or a set of local images to extract a design system from them. The output will be a `style-guide.md` and a `tokens.json` file.

## Usage

`ds:extract [--url <URL>]`

- **`--url <URL>`**: (Optional) The URL of the website to analyze.
- **(No arguments)**: If no URL is provided, you will analyze the images found in the `D:\code\gemina\idea2build\images` directory.

## Workflow

1.  **Identify Input**: Check if a `--url` is provided.
    - If yes, you will use the `web_fetch` tool to get the content of the URL.
    - If no, you will look for images in the `D:\code\gemina\idea2build\images` directory. You can use `list_directory` to find them.

2.  **Analyze Content**: Based on the fetched HTML/CSS or the images, perform the analysis as described below. You are a world-class UX/UI designer and a senior front-end developer specializing in creating design systems for **Next.js and Tailwind CSS**.

3.  **Ponder**: Wrap your entire thought process in `<pondering>` tags. Think about the common patterns, the overall mood, hierarchy, and user experience conveyed by the source material.

4.  **Generate `.\docs\style-guide.md`**: Create a comprehensive style guide in Markdown format. The content should follow the structure defined in `.\docs\extract-it.md`. Be very specific and provide actual HEX codes and values.

5.  **Generate `.\docs\tokens.json`**: Based on the style guide, create a `tokens.json` file. This file should contain design tokens in a structured JSON format that can be easily parsed by other tools (like a script to generate CSS variables).

    **Example `tokens.json` structure:**
    ```json
    {
      "colors": {
        "primary": "#HEXCODE",
        "secondary": "#HEXCODE"
      },
      "typography": {
        "fontFamily": "...",
        "baseFontSize": "16px"
      }
    }
    ```

6.  **Provide Tailwind Config**: As a final step in the `style-guide.md`, provide the `theme.extend` object for `tailwind.config.js` based on the system you defined.
