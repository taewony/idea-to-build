# GameFinder (NextJS) Application Blueprint

This document outlines the architectural blueprint for the GameFinder application, detailing its pages, components, and key interactive elements.

## 1. Pages & Views

The application operates as a Single Page Application (SPA) with three primary views rendered within the main `HomePage` component.

-   **Home View (`'home'`)**: The default landing page. It focuses on searching for games.
-   **Game Detail View (`'detail'`)**: Displays comprehensive, AI-generated details for a selected game.
-   **Personalized View (`'personalized'`)**: Shown after a user "logs in." It displays curated and trending game lists.
